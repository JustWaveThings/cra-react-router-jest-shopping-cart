> A web app that using many of the features of React Router v6, calls an API, display's the product and the information returned, and has a cart functionality.

- Uses React functional components, React Router, and loaders
- Reduced code complexity by eliminating excessive useEffect() calls
- Implemented loaders to prevent a 'loading waterfall' effect commonly seen in less sophisticated implementations
- Populated product data by making an asynchronous API call to a shopping products API
